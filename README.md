Project 1:
Data reporting and visualization using Power BI

This project entails the development of interactive dashboards in Power BI for the purpose of data reporting
and visualization, utilizing a designated data warehouse (AdventureWorksDW2019). The primary objective is to
produce a meticulously formatted and thoroughly documented Power BI project file that offers extensive 
interaction functionalities catered to the needs of business users.

Project 2:
Data exploration and preprocessing

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a fundamental component
of Data Science. Your objective will be to thoroughly explore a provided dataset, extracting valuable 
insights regarding its structure, quality, and key characteristics.

Final Project:
Cement Mill Plant Dataset Analysis for Predictive Modeling of Operating Conditions

This project involves analyzing a 6-month dataset from a cement mill plant, focusing on two distinct 
problems. The tasks include addressing dataset irregularities, understanding statistical 
characteristics of input and output variables, quantifying time delays, exploring correlations,
and developing a predictive model for the output variable based on the input variables. 
Additionally, investigating the potential use of additional variables for model improvement 
is considered. The goal is to create a well-documented analysis that enables accurate predictions
of the output variable in 30-second intervals for the next 5 minutes, based on the mill's operating
conditions. It should be noted that predictions are focused on normal operating conditions,excluding
mill start-up and shutdown periods.
